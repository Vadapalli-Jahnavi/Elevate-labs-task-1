#### E-commerce Database Schema #####

## Overview ##

This project is about designing an **E-commerce database** as part of a SQL learning task.
I created tables, defined primary and foreign keys, and designed an ER diagram.

## Deliverables

* `e-commerce.sql` → SQL script with all `CREATE TABLE` statements.
* `ER diagram-t1.png` → Entity-Relationship Diagram of the schema.
* `screenshots/` → Extra screenshots (Workbench)
* `README.md` → Documentation of what I did.

## Tools Used

* MySQL Workbench (for schema design)
* dbdiagram.io (for ER diagram)
* GitHub (for submission)
